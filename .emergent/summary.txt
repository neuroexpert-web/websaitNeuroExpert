The AI engineer, E1, initiated the NeuroExpert application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, with a green-dark-theme design. The trajectory outlines extensive feature development and refinements based on user feedback. Key achievements include implementing a dynamic landing page with a video background, creating interactive, neon-animated service cards leading to detailed modals, and integrating an AI chat assistant (Claude Sonnet 4) with Telegram. Significant efforts were directed towards mobile responsiveness across all components. Subsequent work focused on improving the Portfolio section, enhancing the Contact Form with Telegram integration (which required several fixes for bot token and chat ID), creating a seamless global video background, and adding moderate CSS animations to titles and texts. The AI engineer also integrated a comprehensive AI consultant persona, refined pricing based on market research, and iteratively improved service modal content, bonuses, FAQs, and technical support details, culminating in the current task of rephrasing a technical support statement for clarity.

NeuroExpert aims to be a premium, conversion-optimized application with a rich social colors and life aesthetic, featuring a main page video background and a global seamless video background for other sections. It requires an immediate AI chat assistant (Claude Sonnet 4), Telegram bot integration for client requests, and SEO optimization. The design emphasizes agency-quality, layered elements, glass-morphism, and smooth animations.

Key integrated features: a dynamic landing page (Hero, service cards, Portfolio, Advantages, Team, Contact Form, Footer, Sticky CTA), four interactive service modals (Digital Audit, Websites Turnkey, AI Assistant Implementation, Technical Support) with detailed content and integrated AI chat. All sections are adapted for mobile, animated titles and texts, a redesigned header with animated navigation, and a functional contact form that sends messages to Telegram. The AI consultant within the chat is trained with extensive persona, service details, and market-aligned pricing. Recent content refinements include Audit steps, client bonuses, and rephrased FAQs for clarity and sales focus.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on refining the textual content within the service modals, specifically focusing on the Technical Support section. The last completed task was to replace the alarming phrase навесили вирусы with the more professional внедрили вредоносный код within the client stories. The AI engineer has identified two occurrences of the phrase and successfully updated them in . Screenshots confirmed the updated wording.

The current work involves addressing the user's latest request: to rephrase a specific statement regarding urgent repairs in the Technical Support section for better clarity. The AI engineer is about to locate the phrase Срочный ремонт стоит × 3 → платите 50 000₽ за то, что можно было предотвратить за 5 000₽ in the codebase and reformulate it to be more easily understood by clients. This is the last pending task from the user's explicit requests in the trajectory.
