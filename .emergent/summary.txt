The AI engineer successfully developed the NeuroExpert application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, featuring a green-dark-theme. The trajectory showcases extensive feature development and iterative refinements. Key accomplishments include implementing a dynamic landing page with a global seamless video background, interactive service cards leading to detailed modals, and an integrated AI chat assistant (Claude Sonnet 4, later expanded to include GPT-4o) with Telegram. Significant effort was dedicated to mobile responsiveness, content refinement across service modals, and integrating an AI consultant persona with improved system prompts. Recent work focused on performance optimization (video/image compression, lazy loading), Yandex Metrika integration troubleshooting, and adding social media links (VK, Telegram). The engineer addressed user feedback to refine guarantees, update team photos, and enhance AI chat visuals. The trajectory concludes with the user seeking final verification before redeployment, indicating successful feature implementation but a need for clarity on the deployment process and optimization impact.

<product_requirements>
NeuroExpert is envisioned as a premium, conversion-optimized application with a rich social colors and life aesthetic. It features a main page video background, transitioning to a global seamless video background for other sections. Core functionalities include an immediate AI chat assistant (initially Claude Sonnet 4, expanded to GPT-4o with model selection and refined prompts), and Telegram bot integration for client requests from a functional contact form. The design prioritizes agency-quality, layered elements, glass-morphism, and smooth animations, with all sections adapted for mobile.

Implemented features include a dynamic landing page (Hero, service cards, Portfolio, Advantages, Team, Contact Form, Footer, Sticky CTA), four interactive service modals (Digital Audit, Websites Turnkey, AI Assistant Implementation, Technical Support) with updated content, bonuses, and rephrased FAQs. The header and navigation are redesigned with animations. Performance optimization was done for video backgrounds and team images. Social media links (VK, Telegram) have been added, and Yandex Metrika integrated for analytics.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main component, renders  and orchestrates other major sections.
-   : Global styles, Tailwind CSS imports, theme variables.
-   : Top section, previously had a dedicated video, now removed to use global background. Headline text and styling updated.
-   : Displays service cards and modals. Received extensive content updates for Technical Support packages and Digital Audit guarantees. Buttons in service modals (AI Assistant, Technical Support) were fixed, and some removed per user request.
-   : Displays client cases. Content updated, confirmed to use gradients, not images.
-   : User inquiry form, integrates with backend.
-   : Global sticky AI chat button. Updated to include model selection (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o) via a burger menu, enhanced system prompt for AI, and significant visual improvements (rounded corners, animations, input text visibility/color fix).
-   : Navigation bar. Updated for mobile responsiveness, added animated Начать button, and included VK and Telegram social media buttons.
-   : FastAPI backend. Handles AI chat and contact form submissions. Updated with improved AI consultant persona prompt, market-aligned pricing, and model selection logic for LLM calls. Telegram integration for contact form is functional.
-   : Stores mock data, specifically updated for team member details (names, roles, and image URLs, initially changed to gradients then back to optimized WebP images).
-   : Renders a single, fixed, seamless video background for the entire application. Updated multiple times to use new user-provided video files, with significant CSS adjustments to remove dark bars and ensure full-screen, seamless looping.
-   : Main HTML file. Yandex Metrika tracking script was integrated into this file.
-   : Displays team member cards. Updated to render dynamic images from , supporting gradients initially, then actual photos, with lazy loading applied for performance.

<pending_tasks>
-   Confirm final deployment readiness of the project, including the latest video background and Yandex Metrika integration.
-   Assist the user in correctly deploying the updated project to production on Emergent.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive performance audit of the NeuroExpert website, with a particular focus on the video background loading. Critical issues were identified: the main video background (WebM) was excessively large (17 MB), and team member images (PNG) were also unoptimized (around 1 MB each).

The AI engineer initiated and executed several urgent optimizations:
1.  **Video Optimization**: The  component was edited to improve video loading. The user subsequently provided a new, compressed MP4 video () to replace all old video files, which the AI engineer was in the process of implementing.
2.  **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading was added for team images in , and  was updated to use user-provided, converted WebP versions of the team member photos, reducing their file size.
3.  **AIChat Optimization**: Minor optimizations were also applied to the  component.

After these optimizations, the frontend service was restarted, and a visual check confirmed the site loaded and worked. The user is currently confused about the sequence of recent changes (Yandex Metrika, video background) and wishes to redeploy the project to production, seeking final verification and assistance with the deployment process. The AI engineer has acknowledged this and is preparing to verify everything before guiding the user through the production deployment.
