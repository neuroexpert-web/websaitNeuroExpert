# Единый бесшовный видео фон - Summary of Changes

## Problem Solved
Previously, the website had two separate video elements:
1. A local `VideoBackground` component in the Hero section
2. A `GlobalVideoBackground` component for other sections

This caused a visible seam/transition when scrolling from the Hero to other sections.

## Solution Implemented
Removed the separate video from the Hero section and now use a single unified `GlobalVideoBackground` component for the entire site.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed import of `VideoBackground` component
- ✅ Removed `<VideoBackground />` element from Hero section
- ✅ Hero now uses the global fixed video background

**Result:** Hero section no longer has its own video element.

### 2. `frontend/src/App.js`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated comment to reflect that `GlobalVideoBackground` is now for the entire site, not just "sections after Hero"
- ✅ Updated Hero section comment to remove "с видео" since it no longer has its own video

**Result:** Documentation accurately reflects the unified video background approach.

## Technical Implementation Details

### GlobalVideoBackground Component (unchanged, already correct)
The existing `GlobalVideoBackground` component already had the correct setup:
- **Position:** `fixed inset-0` - stays in place while scrolling
- **Z-index:** `z-0` - below all content
- **Video attributes:** `autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, `playsInline` for seamless looping
- **Fallback:** Animated gradient background for slow connections or errors
- **Video source:** Cloudinary-hosted optimized video with multiple formats (MP4, WebM)

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✅

✅ **No visible seam between first page and other sections**
   - Single video element is used throughout the entire site

✅ **One video plays smoothly in background of entire site**
   - `GlobalVideoBackground` with `fixed` position covers all sections

✅ **Video is looped without pauses or breaks**
   - Video element has `loop` attribute and seamless video file

✅ **One video element for entire site from start to finish**
   - Only one `<video>` element exists in the DOM

✅ **Video element is fixed/absolute with z-index below content**
   - `fixed inset-0` with `z-0` positioning

✅ **Attributes preserved: autoplay, muted, playsinline, loop**
   - All required attributes are present in `GlobalVideoBackground`

✅ **Video not recreated when scrolling between sections**
   - Fixed position video element never unmounts or recreates

## Testing
- Build compiled successfully with no errors
- Only pre-existing ESLint warnings (unrelated to video background changes)
- No import errors or broken references

## Benefits
1. **Seamless UX:** No visible transition or "jump" between sections
2. **Performance:** Single video element reduces memory usage
3. **Maintainability:** Simpler architecture with one video component
4. **Consistency:** Same video plays throughout the entire user journey
